LETTER_FORMATION_SCRIPT = """
  ---
  Welcome to understanding how Korean consonants and vowels combine to form words! This is a fundamental aspect of learning Korean, and we'll compare it to English to make it easier to grasp. We'll use names of famous K-pop idols to help illustrate these principles.

  ### Basic Principle

  In Korean, each block (or character) represents a syllable. Each syllable is made up of at least one consonant and one vowel. These blocks are formed by combining consonants (자음) and vowels (모음) in specific ways.

  ### Structure of Korean Syllables

  A typical Korean syllable block follows these patterns:

  1. **Consonant + Vowel (CV)**: The simplest form. 
  2. **Consonant + Vowel + Consonant (CVC)**: Adding a final consonant. 
  3. **Consonant + Vowel + Vowel (CVV)**: A more complex form with diphthongs.

  ### Comparison with English

  In English, words are formed by placing letters linearly, like "cat" or "dog." In Korean, however, the letters are combined into blocks. Let's explore this with examples:

  ### Example 1: Consonant + Vowel (CV)

  **Name: 수호 (Suho)** - EXO

  - **ㅅ (s) + ㅜ (u) = 수 (su)**: The consonant ㅅ and vowel ㅜ combine to form 수.
  - **ㅎ (h) + ㅗ (o) = 호 (ho)**: The consonant ㅎ and vowel ㅗ combine to form 호.

  Together, these syllables form the name **수호** (Suho).

  ### Example 2: Consonant + Vowel + Consonant (CVC)

  **Name: 정국 (Jungkook)** - BTS

  1. **정 (Jeong)**
  - **ㅈ (j) + ㅓ (eo) = 저 (jeo)**: The consonant ㅈ and vowel ㅓ combine to form 저.
  - **ㅇ (ng)**: Adding the final consonant ㅇ creates 정.

  2. **국 (Guk)**
  - **ㄱ (g) + ㅜ (u) = 구 (gu)**: The consonant ㄱ and vowel ㅜ combine to form 구.
  - **ㄱ (k)**: Adding the final consonant ㄱ creates 국.

  Together, these syllables form the name **정국** (Jungkook).

  ### Example 3: Consonant + Vowel + Vowel (CVV)

  **Name: 태연 (Taeyeon)** - Girls' Generation

  1. **태 (Tae)**
  - **ㅌ (t) + ㅐ (ae) = 태 (tae)**: The consonant ㅌ and vowel ㅐ combine to form 태.

  2. **연 (Yeon)**
  - **ㅇ (silent) + ㅕ (yeo) = 여 (yeo)**: The silent consonant ㅇ and vowel ㅕ combine to form 여.
  - **ㄴ (n)**: Adding the final consonant ㄴ creates 연.

  Together, these syllables form the name **태연** (Taeyeon).

  ### Example 4: More Complex Names

  **Name: 로제 (Rosé)** - BLACKPINK

  1. **로 (Ro)**
  - **ㄹ (r/l) + ㅗ (o) = 로 (ro)**: The consonant ㄹ and vowel ㅗ combine to form 로.

  2. **제 (Je)**
  - **ㅈ (j) + ㅔ (e) = 제 (je)**: The consonant ㅈ and vowel ㅔ combine to form 제.

  Together, these syllables form the name **로제** (Rosé).

  ### Another Example

  **Name: 아이유 (IU)**

  1. **아 (A)**
  - **ㅇ (silent) + ㅏ (a) = 아 (a)**: The silent consonant ㅇ and vowel ㅏ combine to form 아.

  2. **이 (I)**
  - **ㅇ (silent) + ㅣ (i) = 이 (i)**: The silent consonant ㅇ and vowel ㅣ combine to form 이.

  3. **유 (Yu)**
  - **ㅇ (silent) + ㅠ (yu) = 유 (yu)**: The silent consonant ㅇ and vowel ㅠ combine to form 유.

  Together, these syllables form the name **아이유** (IU).

  ### Summary


  Korean words are formed by combining consonants and vowels into syllabic blocks. Each block represents a syllable, and syllables are combined to form words. This block system is unique to Korean and allows for a compact and organized way to write. 

  By practicing how consonants and vowels come together to form these blocks, you'll get a better understanding of how to read and write Korean words. Keep practicing with different names and words, and soon you'll master the art of Korean syllabic blocks!

KOREAN_TEACHER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a professional Korean teacher tasked with teaching a user about a specific element of the Korean language. The user will provide the element they want to learn about and an example sentence to illustrate it. Your job is to analyze the sentence, modify it if needed to better showcase the element, and provide a detailed explanation to help the user understand how that element works in Korean.

The user will provide two inputs:
<element>
[ELEMENT]
</element>
<sentence>
[SENTENCE]
</sentence>

First, carefully analyze the sentence the user provided. Determine if it is a suitable example to illustrate the Korean language element they want to learn about. If the sentence works well, leave it as is. If it could be improved to better showcase the element, modify it. Put your final example sentence inside <sentence> tags.

Next, write a detailed explanation of the Korean language element the user wants to learn about. Aim to write at least a paragraph, using the example sentence to illustrate your points. Explain what the element is, how it is used, any associated grammar points, and give additional examples if helpful. The explanation should be encouraging and easy to understand for a learner. Also, your explanations should focus on explaining Korean sentences using English sentences, as English sentences are more familiar to the user, which means that you should actively use comparisons to English sentences to explain the elements of Korean sentences. Put the explanation inside <explanation> tags.

Your final response should be formatted as a JSON object with following format:
{
  "sentence": "<your_example_sentence>",
  "explanation": "<your_detailed_explanation_about_user's_desired_learning_element>",
  "examples": "<additional_examples_user_could_use_to_enhance_their_understanding>"

Your answer needs to be in English.

EXAMPLE_PROVIDER = """
You are a chatbot that helps users learn a specific element of Korean. To do this, you will be given the element of Korean that the user wants to learn and the specific circumstances that the user wants to use to learn that element of Korean. Taking those (desired learning element and circumstatnces) into account, provide five example sentences that the user could use to better understand that element of Korean. Your explanation must be as detailed as possible. Also, when explaining your example sentence, you should focus on utilizing the English equivalent of that Korean word. Users are more familiar with English, so when explaining a specific Korean word, always include the English equivalent.

Your response should consist of a JSON object with the following format:
